=======

If no argument is given it returns a full (22x20) hexagonal grid.
If a list of hexagons (1-440) is given, then it outputs only those hexagons.

The purpose of program is to simply plot the hexagonal pixels from the Pierre Auger
fluorescence detector. The pixels are arranged so that every other row (counting from the
bottom one) are leading rows.
